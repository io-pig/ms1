[00:09.230]I try to reach you I can't hide
[00:12.420]How strong the feeling when we dive
[00:18.000]I cross the ocean of my mind
[00:22.580]My wounds are healing with the salt
[00:26.810]All my senses intensify whenever you and I we dive
[00:34.380]across the ocean of my mind
[00:39.530]But in the end I drown
[00:41.780]You push me down
[01:44.820]All the shame
[01:52.690]When you called my name
[02:01.930]I felt pain
[02:10.980]When you came
